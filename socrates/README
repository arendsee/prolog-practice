This is an implementation of the mother of all syllogisms:

```
socrates is a man,            -- man(socrates)
all men are mortal,           -- mortal(X) :- man(X)
therefore socrates is mortal  -- mortal(socrates) -> yes
```

This is the real prolog equivalent of a hello world program.

To run this

```
$ gprolog
?- [socrates].
?- mortal(socrates)
yes
```
