# A first crack

See the commit message for notes

The code used here is copied from [McCann's tutorial](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~cannata/cs345/Class%20Notes/12%20prolog_intro.pdf).

I should work through his tutorial with great care. It discusses the underlying
logic of Prolog and the driving algorithm (Horn clause reduction?).
